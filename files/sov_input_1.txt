34154692|t|The federal government and Canada's COVID-19 responses: from 'we're ready, we're prepared' to 'fires are burning'.
This paper critically reviews Canada's response to the COVID-19 pandemic with a focus on the role of the federal government in this public health emergency, considering areas within its jurisdiction (international borders), areas where an increased federal role may be warranted (long-term care), as well as its technical role in terms of generating evidence and supporting public health surveillance, and its convening role to support collaboration across the country.

34255304|t|SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Racial Disparities in Children: Protective Mechanisms and Severe Complications Related to MIS-C.
Epidemiologic data and case studies have indicated that children are less susceptible to more severe clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a finding that may be due to differences in the cytokine response generated by the innate immune system, high amounts of ACE-2 which maintain homeostatic functions by preventing inflammation, and trained immunity acquired from regular vaccinations.

While the cause-effect relationship between lifestyle behaviors and chronic disease is not always a certainty, and genetic predisposition can independently lead to premature chronic disease, the likelihood of developing one or more chronic conditions is significantly higher in those who: (1) lead sedentary lifestyles; (2) consume unhealthy diets; (3) smoke; or (4) have excess body mass.

34391763|t|What Comes First, the Behavior or the Condition? In the COVID-19 Era, It May Go Both Ways.
However, a body of evidence has demonstrated that unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and characteristics as well as being diagnosed with one or more chronic diseases does significantly increase the risk for a complicated medical course in individuals infected with COVID-19.

Moreover, the cause-effect relationship between lifestyle behaviors and characteristics and COVID-19 may eventually prove to go both ways, as the pandemic may lead to a higher prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and characteristics over the long term that eventually leads to a higher prevalence of chronic disease.

These findings are insightful because AT2 cells are known to contain an elegant quality control network to respond to intrinsic or extrinsic stress; a failure of such quality control results in diverse cellular phenotypes, of which ER stress appears to be a point of convergence, which appears to be sufficient to drive downstream fibrotic remodeling in the lung.Implications of all the available evidence: Because unbiased computational methods identified the shared fundamental aspects of gene expression and cellular processes between COVID-19 and IPF, the impact of our findings is likely to go beyond COVID-19 or any viral pandemic.

If their performance, unlike that of vaccines, is for the moment only qualified as moderate therapeutic progress (moderate clinical added value) in the therapeutic strategies against these diseases, it should be taken into account that their initial evaluation was penalized by a certain number of unfavorable factors: trials of small numbers, therapeutic modalities to be refined, the lack of hindsight on their long-term effects but especially the choice of the moment of the initiation of the treatment in the natural evolution of the sickness.
