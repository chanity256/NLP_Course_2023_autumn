36039786|t|Lifting non-pharmaceutical interventions following the COVID-19 pandemic - the quiet before the storm?
While this was a welcome effect for already strained healthcare systems, prolonged low exposure to pathogens may result in an increased pool of individuals susceptible to certain diseases.

Out-of-season or unusually intense outbreaks of non-vaccine preventable diseases have already been documented as NPIs were gradually eased.

36039786|t|Lifting non-pharmaceutical interventions following the COVID-19 pandemic - the quiet before the storm?
In the context of widespread and important disruptions in national vaccination programs during the early phase of the pandemic, the risk of vaccine-preventable disease resurgence after NPIs are lifted cannot be excluded either.

36039786|t|Lifting non-pharmaceutical interventions following the COVID-19 pandemic - the quiet before the storm?

36040283|t|What were the historical reasons for the resistance to recognizing airborne transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic?
We sought to explain this controversy through a historical analysis of transmission research in other diseases.

36040283|t|What were the historical reasons for the resistance to recognizing airborne transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic?
For most of human history, the dominant paradigm was that many diseases were carried by the air, often over long distances and in a phantasmagorical way.

36040283|t|What were the historical reasons for the resistance to recognizing airborne transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic?
This miasmatic paradigm was challenged in the mid to late 19th century with the rise of germ theory, and as diseases such as cholera, puerperal fever, and malaria were found to actually transmit in other ways.

36040283|t|What were the historical reasons for the resistance to recognizing airborne transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic?
For the next five decades, airborne transmission was considered of negligible or minor importance for all major respiratory diseases, until a demonstration of airborne transmission of tuberculosis (which had been mistakenly thought to be transmitted by droplets) in 1962.

36040283|t|What were the historical reasons for the resistance to recognizing airborne transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic?
The contact/droplet paradigm remained dominant, and only a few diseases were widely accepted as airborne before COVID-19: those that were clearly transmitted to people not in the same room.

Subsequently, even if crises may manifest heterogeneously and the long-term impact of implementing recovery policies cannot be accurately known ex ante by governments, institutions could adapt themselves to changing circumstances and respond promptly and appropriately to emerging shocks only if their functioning framework had been well set up by the outbreak of the crisis.

36160294|t|European Governments' Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic during the First Wave: Resetting Governance Systems to Cope More Effectively with Future Shocks.
Considering these aspects, the main questions that this paper aims to answer are: How effective have governmental measures in European countries been in combating the COVID-19 crisis?; Could the solutions offered by the European states' governments have an influence on diminishing the intensity of negative effects of a possible more serious return of this health crisis? What more could national authorities and international actors do to control the epidemiological evolution of SARS-CoV-2? Is a generic European Union policy helpful or should there be a case for local policy? Based on these issues, a comprehensive picture of the differences between the East and the West of Europe in terms of some medical, socio-economic, institutional and cultural factors will be outlined, in order to emphasize which of the two groups better-handled the COVID-19 situation in the first wave, covering the lockdown period (March 1, 2020 - June 1, 2020) and the relaxation period (June 1, 2020 - September 1, 2020); at the same time, some policy recommendations on how governments should more effectively manage future similar crises to generate a higher resilience of the systems will be provided..

The myosin loss was coupled to a general transcriptional downregulation of myofibrillar proteins (P < 0.05; absolute fold change >2) and activation of protein degradation pathways (false discovery rate [FDR] <0.1), resulting in significant muscle fibre atrophy and loss in force generation capacity, which declined >65% during the 12 day observation period (muscle fibre cross-sectional area [CSA] and maximum single muscle fibre force normalized to CSA [specific force] declined 30% [P < 0.007] and 50% [P < 0.0001], respectively).

36238449|t|Applying stem cell therapy in intractable diseases: a narrative review of decades of progress and challenges.
Background and Objective: Stem cell therapy (SCT) is one of the vastly researched branches of regenerative medicine as a therapeutic tool to treat incurable diseases.

36238449|t|Applying stem cell therapy in intractable diseases: a narrative review of decades of progress and challenges.
With the use of human stem cells such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs), adult stem cells (ASCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), stem cell therapy aims to regenerate or repair damaged tissues and congenital defects.

36504562|t|Diversity's Pandemic Distractions.
In the long term, diversity in the biomedical context of pandemic response not only distracts attention from important structural causes of health injustice, but it also focuses attention on the genetics of disparities in a manner that has the potential to reinforce pernicious and false ideas of essential biological difference among racial groups.

36504562|t|Diversity's Pandemic Distractions.

It will argue that in failing to clearly distinguish social and biological rationales for diversity, such framings, while generally well-intentioned, are poorly supported and work in tandem with the geneticization of racial disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality to locate the causes of disparities in the minds and bodies of minoritized populations; again this distracts attention from the historical and structural forces contributing to such disparities.
