35251382|t|Prostate cancer treatment costs increase more rapidly than for any other cancer-how to reverse the trend?
In general, two main components are making currently applied reactive (management of clinically manifested disease) PCa treatment particularly expensive.

35251382|t|Prostate cancer treatment costs increase more rapidly than for any other cancer-how to reverse the trend?
On one hand, it is rapidly increasing incidence of the disease and metastatic PCa as its subtype.

35251382|t|Prostate cancer treatment costs increase more rapidly than for any other cancer-how to reverse the trend?
To this end, rapidly increasing PCa incidence rates in young and middle-aged male sub-populations should be taken into account as a long-term contributor to the metastatic disease potentially developed later on in life.

35251382|t|Prostate cancer treatment costs increase more rapidly than for any other cancer-how to reverse the trend?
In our strategic paper, we exemplify challenging PCa management by providing detailed expert recommendations for primary (health risk assessment), secondary (prediction and prevention of metastatic disease in PCa) and tertiary (making palliative care to the management of chronic disease) care in the framework of predictive, preventive and personalised medicine..

Tauhe use of cannabis and nicotine showed increasing trends, as well as the use of cocaine, but to a lesser extent, while the use of MDMA (ecstasy) showed a decrease.4 In a review of 45 cross-sectional studies conducted between December 2019 and November 2020, alcohol use was on the rise overall, despite geographical variations, as was the use of other addictive substances, cannabis in particular.5 It should be noted that those who increased alcohol use during quarantine were those exhibiting higher levels of negative emotionality mechanisms.6 In Greece, an online cross-sectional survey in April 2020 in the general population during the first lockdown showed a reduction in alcohol use (43.7% of alcohol users reduced or quit), a reduction in cannabis (67.3% quit), while 33.3% increased nicotine use.

35255473|t|Substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic: What is really happening?
These changes were attributed to the limitation of alcohol availability, social distancing, changes in daily routine and income reduction.7,8 Also, wastewater samples from Athens, analyzed by the Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry of EKPA, showed a significant increase in the use of cocaine (67%), amphetamine (350%) and methamphetamine (37%), and a decrease in the use of MDMA (- 38%) during the first lockdown, compared to the corresponding period of the previous year.9 Analysis of wastewater samples from other European cities "suggest that levels of use of most drugs appear generally lower during the initial lockdowns, but then appear to bounce back once lockdown was lifted.

35255473|t|Substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic: What is really happening?
In general terms, there appears to have been less consumer interest in drugs usually associated with recreational events, such as MDMA, and greater interest in drugs linked with home use.

RESULTS: Our work demonstrates that long-term SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cell responses feature dual IFNgamma and IL-2 responses, whereas cross-reactive memory T cell responses primarily generate IFNgamma in response to SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation.

Does the host's dysregulated immune counter-offensive contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, emerging as Parkinson's disease, in a complex interrelation between genetic and epigenetic risk factors? A synthetic and systematic literature review was accomplished based on the "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Principles Reviews and Meta-Analyses" (PRISMA) methodology, including registration on the specific online platform: International prospective register of systematic reviews-PROSPERO, no.
