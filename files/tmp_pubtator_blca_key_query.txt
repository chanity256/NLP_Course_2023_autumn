34154692|t|The federal government and Canada's COVID-19 responses: from 'we're ready, we're prepared' to 'fires are burning'.
This paper critically reviews Canada's response to the COVID-19 pandemic with a focus on the role of the federal government in this public health emergency, considering areas within its jurisdiction (international borders), areas where an increased federal role may be warranted (long-term care), as well as its technical role in terms of generating evidence and supporting public health surveillance, and its convening role to support collaboration across the country.

34255304|t|SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Racial Disparities in Children: Protective Mechanisms and Severe Complications Related to MIS-C.
Epidemiologic data and case studies have indicated that children are less susceptible to more severe clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a finding that may be due to differences in the cytokine response generated by the innate immune system, high amounts of ACE-2 which maintain homeostatic functions by preventing inflammation, and trained immunity acquired from regular vaccinations.

While the cause-effect relationship between lifestyle behaviors and chronic disease is not always a certainty, and genetic predisposition can independently lead to premature chronic disease, the likelihood of developing one or more chronic conditions is significantly higher in those who: (1) lead sedentary lifestyles; (2) consume unhealthy diets; (3) smoke; or (4) have excess body mass.

34391763|t|What Comes First, the Behavior or the Condition? In the COVID-19 Era, It May Go Both Ways.
However, a body of evidence has demonstrated that unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and characteristics as well as being diagnosed with one or more chronic diseases does significantly increase the risk for a complicated medical course in individuals infected with COVID-19.

Moreover, the cause-effect relationship between lifestyle behaviors and characteristics and COVID-19 may eventually prove to go both ways, as the pandemic may lead to a higher prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and characteristics over the long term that eventually leads to a higher prevalence of chronic disease.

These findings are insightful because AT2 cells are known to contain an elegant quality control network to respond to intrinsic or extrinsic stress; a failure of such quality control results in diverse cellular phenotypes, of which ER stress appears to be a point of convergence, which appears to be sufficient to drive downstream fibrotic remodeling in the lung.Implications of all the available evidence: Because unbiased computational methods identified the shared fundamental aspects of gene expression and cellular processes between COVID-19 and IPF, the impact of our findings is likely to go beyond COVID-19 or any viral pandemic.

35255473|t|Substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic: What is really happening?
These changes were attributed to the limitation of alcohol availability, social distancing, changes in daily routine and income reduction.7,8 Also, wastewater samples from Athens, analyzed by the Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry of EKPA, showed a significant increase in the use of cocaine (67%), amphetamine (350%) and methamphetamine (37%), and a decrease in the use of MDMA (- 38%) during the first lockdown, compared to the corresponding period of the previous year.9 Analysis of wastewater samples from other European cities "suggest that levels of use of most drugs appear generally lower during the initial lockdowns, but then appear to bounce back once lockdown was lifted.

35440039|t|United, can we be stronger? Did French general practitioners in multi-professional groups provide more chronic care follow-up during lockdown?
We use probit and bivariate probit models (adjusted for endogeneity of choice of engagement in MGP) to test whether GPs in MGP had significantly different responses to the Covid-19 crisis compared to those practicing outside MGP.

We sought to explain this controversy through a historical analysis of transmission research in other diseases.

36040283|t|What were the historical reasons for the resistance to recognizing airborne transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic?
For most of human history, the dominant paradigm was that many diseases were carried by the air, often over long distances and in a phantasmagorical way.

36040283|t|What were the historical reasons for the resistance to recognizing airborne transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic?
This miasmatic paradigm was challenged in the mid to late 19th century with the rise of germ theory, and as diseases such as cholera, puerperal fever, and malaria were found to actually transmit in other ways.

Subsequently, even if crises may manifest heterogeneously and the long-term impact of implementing recovery policies cannot be accurately known ex ante by governments, institutions could adapt themselves to changing circumstances and respond promptly and appropriately to emerging shocks only if their functioning framework had been well set up by the outbreak of the crisis.

36160294|t|European Governments' Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic during the First Wave: Resetting Governance Systems to Cope More Effectively with Future Shocks.
Considering these aspects, the main questions that this paper aims to answer are: How effective have governmental measures in European countries been in combating the COVID-19 crisis?; Could the solutions offered by the European states' governments have an influence on diminishing the intensity of negative effects of a possible more serious return of this health crisis? What more could national authorities and international actors do to control the epidemiological evolution of SARS-CoV-2? Is a generic European Union policy helpful or should there be a case for local policy? Based on these issues, a comprehensive picture of the differences between the East and the West of Europe in terms of some medical, socio-economic, institutional and cultural factors will be outlined, in order to emphasize which of the two groups better-handled the COVID-19 situation in the first wave, covering the lockdown period (March 1, 2020 - June 1, 2020) and the relaxation period (June 1, 2020 - September 1, 2020); at the same time, some policy recommendations on how governments should more effectively manage future similar crises to generate a higher resilience of the systems will be provided..

First, early on as significant racial disparities in disease incidence and mortality became evident, a frame of race-based genetic difference came to the fore as a possible explanation.

36504562|t|Diversity's Pandemic Distractions.

36504562|t|Diversity's Pandemic Distractions.
In the long term, diversity in the biomedical context of pandemic response not only distracts attention from important structural causes of health injustice, but it also focuses attention on the genetics of disparities in a manner that has the potential to reinforce pernicious and false ideas of essential biological difference among racial groups.

36504562|t|Diversity's Pandemic Distractions.
It proceeds first by exploring the dynamics through which initial responses to racial disparities in COVID-19 became geneticized.

36504562|t|Diversity's Pandemic Distractions.
The next section will examine the subsequent racialization of clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines through the concept of "diversity." It then moves on to explore how the geneticization of COVID-19 racial disparities laid the foundations for a similar geneticization of race in vaccine development.

36504562|t|Diversity's Pandemic Distractions.
It will argue that in failing to clearly distinguish social and biological rationales for diversity, such framings, while generally well-intentioned, are poorly supported and work in tandem with the geneticization of racial disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality to locate the causes of disparities in the minds and bodies of minoritized populations; again this distracts attention from the historical and structural forces contributing to such disparities.
